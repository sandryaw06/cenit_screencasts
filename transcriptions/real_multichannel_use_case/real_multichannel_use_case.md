Now we can look at a real customer case

This client company uses four different marketplaces where they sale electronic devices:
* Overstock
* Fancy
* Houzz
* Walmart

Before Cenit IO, every day, they took the generated orders from each of these stores and manually copied each
order to Shipstation, a cloud solution that facilitates management of shipments through different delivery
companies.

Now with Cenit IO they have a complete automatization of all the operational process. Moving around 3200 orders to
Shipstation since the last december
