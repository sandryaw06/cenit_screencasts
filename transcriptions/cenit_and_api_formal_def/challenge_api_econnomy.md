I would like start my presentation with some challenge around API’s Economy

API’s economy is a general term that describes the way API’s can affect an organization's profitability.
There was a time when only software professionals knew about API’s. Today, business leaders are aware of the
financial impact that APIs can have, and companies are generating revenue by exposing API’s as business building
blocks for third party applications.

This chart from Programmable Web shows as a fact, how the amount of API’s is growing drastically in the last years.

You could think that it should be hard to create a new real API when so many already exist out there solving a lot
problems, but it’s completely wrong, because the options for combining and composing API’s in order to create new
services are significantly higher when the number of API’s grow.

Well, apparently everything looks great, but actually much work remains to be done in order to further help to
unlock the potential of the API Economy.

The creation of new services using existing API’s is usually a nightmare.

Cenit IO, aims to fill that gap to make easy for developers to consume and compose new API’s from existing ones.
