Back to Cenit IO

Cenit IO has been designed to integrate solutions by orchestrating data flows that may involve several APIs, so
being able to connect to an API is one of the basic features that is supported.

Most of the core concepts of Swagger 2.0 API specification can be associated with a corresponding one in Cenit.
Based on this we have built a translator to convert a Swagger 2.0 specification into a Cenit Collection Format.

With Cenit you can have full access to an entire API through a single authorization point and customize response
actions to fit your needs.
