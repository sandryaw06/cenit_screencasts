What kind of formal specifications from consumer and developer perspective we need in Cenit IO?

There are two defined groups of formal API definitions:
- Human-readable definitions
- Machine-readable definitions

Machine-readable definitions are the ones we need, so that we can create new connectors on the fly simply by
loading an API specification

Others might find different reasons for having Machine-readable definitions, like:
- Interactive Documentation
- Server Side Code Deployment
- Client Side Code generation
- Design, Mocking, and Collaboration
- Reusability, Interoperability
- Testing & Monitoring
- Discovery
- Search
- Sharing
