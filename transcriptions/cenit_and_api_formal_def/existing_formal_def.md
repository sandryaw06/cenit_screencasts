Which format, of machine readable definitions we need?

Several format initiatives exist, each one with pros and cons, but an API defined
with any of these formats is really a big step.

Other good news, is that there are some open source transformation tools and cloud
services for converting from one format to another.

Some of these tools are really experimentals but in any case they are helpful
