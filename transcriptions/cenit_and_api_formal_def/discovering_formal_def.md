Now the only thing left to do, is to discover APIs that have Machine-readable definitions.

Unfortunately, this is not an easy task. I know only few companies that maintain official formal definitions, that

exposes formal specifications of the main APIs they have.

One of the main projects that helped us achieve this goal is APIs.guru

They maintain a Wikipedia for Web APIs, a directory with more than 230 REST API specification in Swagger 2.0

It's a maintained collection of Swagger 2.0 specs. But is possible submit new API specifications in any popular
formats, like: Swagger, Blueprint, RAML, etc:
